Simulation tools for the dice game  _Animal_Husbandry_ (Polish: _Hodowla_zwierzÄ…tek_) invented by the mathematician Karol Borsuk and published at his own expense during the Warsaw Uprising in 1943.  

The game has a curious history; a brief synopsis is provided on the [Wikipedia entry][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Husbandry_(game)].  For a description of the game (and the Perl 6 programming challenge), please see Carl's original writeup:
